# Odin Recipes

The Odin Project is a community committed to provide world-class and free coding education for anyone eager to learn.[^1]
Recently, I decided to read its curriculum to understand how it is organized, and maybe take the React path, just for the sake of it.

This project is the first one of the series before starting a path:

1. [Full Stack Ruby on Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript)
2. [Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails)

Since this project is part of the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations), it motivates you to create a repository, a github account, your very own gitconfig file. And this repository, is a testimony of that.

Regarding to this project, is about recipes, those algorithms to prepare food, if well executed, delicious and efficiently made food!

Thank you for reading this, and, please, support [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) if you wish to help others to prepare food, I meant, to code they own programs.

By the way the banner seems covered in blood, but it isn't, it's tomato sauce with basil and salt, a lot of salt.
